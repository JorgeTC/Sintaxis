# Sintaxis

The user whose movies are to be read must be entered. By default those of "Jorge" are read.
To choose another user, simply enter the desired name.
Those available are: 'Sasha', 'Jorge', 'Guillermo', 'Daniel Gallego', 'Luminador', 'Will_llermo', 'Roger Peris', 'Javi', 'El Feo', 'coleto'.
The reading is slow and the program is not able to avoid the captcha.
When FilmAffinity launches the captcha, a window will open in the browser for the user to pass the captcha. When it is done, scraping will continue.
When finished, an excel will be generated with the data read.
